# WA Group Acceptor
 
Overview
This Python script automates the process of accepting WhatsApp group requests based on phone numbers provided in an Excel file. It uses Selenium to interact with WhatsApp Web, matching phone numbers from the Excel sheet to those listed on the group request page, and approves requests if a match is found.

Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Install Python 3.7+ on your system.
Install the following Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas selenium openpyxl
Download Google Chrome and ensure it is up-to-date.
Download the compatible version of ChromeDriver for your Chrome version:
Visit: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Extract the executable and note the path.
2. Preparing the Excel File
Create an Excel file containing a column named Phone with phone numbers (10-digit format) to be approved.
Save the file and note its full path (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Documents\phones_to_accept.xlsx).
3. Configuring the Script
Open the script file in a text editor.
Update the following paths:
Excel File Path: Replace r"C:\Users\gurse\Documents\phones_to_accept.xlsx" with the path to your Excel file.
ChromeDriver Path: Replace r"C:\Users\gurse\Downloads\Compressed\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe" with the path to the ChromeDriver executable.
4. Running the Script
Launch the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Follow the instructions in the terminal:

Scan the QR Code: Open WhatsApp Web and scan the QR code to log in.
Navigate to the Group Request Page: Manually go to the page where group requests are listed.
Press Enter to start processing requests.
The script will:

Match phone numbers on the page with those in the Excel file.
Automatically approve matching requests.
After processing, the script will ask if you want to process another group. Type exit to quit or press Enter to restart.

Features
Batch Processing: Approves multiple requests in a single run.
Reusability: Can be restarted for different groups without restarting the script.
Error Handling: Logs errors for unmatched numbers or failed actions.
Troubleshooting
ChromeDriver Not Found: Ensure the path to ChromeDriver is correct and matches your Chrome version.
Excel File Errors: Verify the column name in your Excel file is Phone and contains valid 10-digit numbers.
Selenium Errors: Update the XPath selectors in the script if WhatsApp Web changes its structure.
Notes
Manual Navigation: The script requires you to manually navigate to the group request page after logging in.
Responsibility: Use this script responsibly and ensure you comply with WhatsApp's terms of service.
Enjoy automating your approvals! ðŸš€
